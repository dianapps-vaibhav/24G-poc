```sh
    blockchain, node, web3, ethereum
```

### Installing

Move to the base directory (example: `blockchain`)

```sh
cd blockchain
```

Clone the repository and move to the project directory

git clone https://github.com/dianapps-vaibhav/24G-poc.git
cd 24G-poc
```

### Install dependencies

## Usage

The scripts are run in the function functionName (of index.js).

The script needs a '.env' file which includes a confidential data. The file is not part of the repository and so the script will not work out-of-the box. However an .env.example file is included to explain the expected format.

```sh
npm start
```
